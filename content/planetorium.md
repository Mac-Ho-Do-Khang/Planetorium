## About Planetorium

We are a space exploration company focused on connecting people with the perfect planet. Whether you're looking for a serene getaway, a new home, or a place to cultivate resources, our AI-based system recommends the ideal planet for your needs. Life is busy, and finding the right celestial body can be overwhelming—so let us handle that. Our platform allows users to input preferences like climate, atmosphere, gravity, and resource availability. Based on this, our algorithm creates a personalized list of planets, tailored to your desires. You can even purchase or lease planets directly from our partners and have the paperwork handled effortlessly. The whole process is packed into a monthly subscription where you receive updates, new planet recommendations, and the option to swap or add more planets to your portfolio.
